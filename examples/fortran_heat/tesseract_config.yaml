  1D transient heat equation solver demonstrating Fortran integration.

  This example shows how to wrap legacy Fortran simulation code as a
  Tesseract using subprocess-based integration. The solver uses an
  explicit finite difference scheme to solve the heat equation:

    dT/dt = alpha * d^2T/dx^2

  Industry relevance: thermal analysis of turbine blades, electronics
  cooling, heat treatment processes, and building physics.
