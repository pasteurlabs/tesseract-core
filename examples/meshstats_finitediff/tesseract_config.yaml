name: meshstats_finitediff
version: "1.0.0"
description: |
  Example Tesseract demonstrating finite difference gradient computation on mesh data.
  This is a variant of the meshstats example that uses finite_difference_jacobian,
  finite_difference_jvp, and finite_difference_vjp instead of hand-written gradients.
