# Setting up the `tesseract_config.yaml` file for the Julia surrogate

Once `tesseract_api.py` is defined, the <span class="product">Tesseract</span> building process is configured in `tesseract_config.yaml`. This file is also generated with some boilerplate code and commented placeholders, as shown below.

```yaml
# Tesseract configuration file
# Generated by tesseract 0.3.0+6.g9ece6f8 on 2024-08-22T09:00:59.002494

name: "check_tesseract"
version: "0+unknown"
description: ""

build_config:
  # Base image to use for the container, must be Ubuntu or Debian-based
  # with Python 3.8 or later
  # base_image: "python:3.12-slim-bookworm"

  # Platform to build the container for. In general, images can only be executed
  # on the platform they were built for.
  # target_platform: "linux/amd64"  # "linux/arm64" for OSX

  # Additional packages to install in the container (via apt-get)
  # extra_packages:
  #  - package_name

  # Data to copy into the container, relative to the project root
  # package_data:
  #  - [path/to/source, path/to/destination]

  # Additional Dockerfile commands to run during the build process
  # custom_build_steps:
  #  - |
  #   RUN echo "Hello, World!"
```
Users can uncomment parts of the code according to their needs and requirments.

In our case, the `tesseract_config.yaml` is shown below. Here, `name` specifies the name of Tesseracted package and can be changed to any other name. `package_data` specifies the data or files that need to be copied or packaged into the environment. We use the `StressSurrogate` Julia package, which must be placed in the same directory. `extra_packages` lists additional packages that need to be installed; here, for example, we list `curl` which is used for downloading various files. `custom_build_steps` lists the custom commands that should be run to set up the environment. Since we are utilizing a Julia package inside the Python environment, these custom commands are required to run during the <span class="product">Tesseract</span> building process.

```yaml
name: "julia_mlp_ellipse_stress"
version: "1.0.0"

build_config:
    package_data:
    - [StressSurrogate, StressSurrogate]

    extra_packages:
    - curl

    custom_build_steps:
    # download julia
    - RUN curl -fsSL https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.10/julia-1.10.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -o julia.tar.gz

    # unpack into folder called julia; delete the tar file
    - RUN mkdir julia && tar -xzf julia.tar.gz -C julia --strip-components=1 && rm julia.tar.gz

    # add julia to PATH
    - ENV PATH=${PATH}:"/tesseract/julia/bin"

    # check julia version
    - RUN julia --version

    # setup julia environment we copied over
    - RUN julia --project="StressSurrogate" -e "import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"

    # set juliacall project location. Used by JuliaPkg underneath. we set this because
    # we need to set a location with write access.
    - ENV PYTHON_JULIAPKG_PROJECT="/tesseract"

    # import juliacall to setup environment
    - RUN python -c "import juliacall"
```
