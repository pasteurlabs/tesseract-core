# Design Optimization using Tesseracted Surrogates

This tutorial demonstrates how to use <span class="product">Tesseracts</span> within a customized optimization solution. It shows how to interact with <span class="product">Tesseracts</span> to obtain surrogate outputs and gradients and it demonstrates
one possible way to formulate optimization problems with the Pasteur Labs <span class="product">Plasmosis</span> engine. This tutorial concludes with an example of Multi-Objective Optimization use two separate <span class="product">Tesseracts</span>.
