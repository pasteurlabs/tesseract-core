This is a gallery of Tesseract examples integrating with Ansys products in different ways, demonstrating the versatility that you can then use to build your own Tesseracts.

You can find these Ansys Tesseracts in the `examples/ansys_integration` directory of the [code repository](https://github.com/pasteurlabs/tesseract-core).
