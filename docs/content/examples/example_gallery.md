## Building Blocks Tesseracts

This is a gallery of Tesseracts that end at the `build` stage of the Tesseract lifecycle, and can act as building blocks for your own Tesseract. You can find these Tesseracts in the `examples` directory of the codebase.

## Beyond the Build

These are some more advanced Tesseracts that showcase the true capabilities of a Tesseract, beyond just the `build` stage of the Tesseract lifecycle.
